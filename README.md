This is an attempt in reworking a C# Call of Duty 4 Master server. The goal of this master server is to keep it clean and efficient as possible.

We will be using the iw3m (https://github.com/Call-of-Duty-Scripts/iw3m) patch to redirect our client to the master server.

I do not own that patch by the way.



Keep in mind this may be a single commit depending how far I want to take this "project" of mine.
